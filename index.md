# [](#header-1)About

I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/jason-xu) at the University of California Los Angeles.

Before joining the faculty at UCLA, I was faculty in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University, where I retain a courtesy appointment as well as in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). Prior to that, I completed an  [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177) with  [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) and received my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Volodymyr Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Some recent and upcoming:

* PhD Alum Raphael Morsomme received the Student Paper Award in the 2025 ASA LiDS Paper Competition. Congratulations!

* I am moving from Duke to UCLA effective January!
