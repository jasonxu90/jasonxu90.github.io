-------
I am currently an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UCLA, hosted by [Dr. Ken Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702 ). Previously, I received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under [Dr. Vladimir Minin](http://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/) in August 2016, where I was supported by an NDSEG Fellowship. 

## Background
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.
