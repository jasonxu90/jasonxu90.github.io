# [](#header-1)About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). 

Prior to joining the faculty at Duke, I worked with [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of California Los Angeles with support from the [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Volodymyr Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Some recent and upcoming:

* Research assistant Rick Presman's [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12258) will be featured as an Oral Presentation at [Artificial Intelligence and Statistics](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/accepted.html) (top ~1.5% of submissions). Congratulations!

* Research assistant Haoyu Jiang received a [Student Paper Award](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/student-paper-competition) from the ASA Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics Section. Congratulations! 

* Research assistant Jenny Huang received the [Quad Fellowship](https://stat.duke.edu/news/senior-jenny-huang-statistical-science-receive-new-quad-fellowship-doctoral-study) and is designated a [Class of 2023 Faculty Scholar](https://today.duke.edu/2022/05/three-juniors-selected-faculty-scholars-excellence-research), the highest honor that the faculty at Duke awards undergraduates. Congratulations!

* I am Area Chairing ICML, AIStat, and ICLR 2023.

* I am on sabbatical leave and am limited in my capacity to serve on committees/take on new students at the moment. I participated as a long-term visitor at the Simons Institute program on [Graph Limits and Processes on Networks: From Epidemics to Misinformation](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/graph2022) in the Fall. Some upcoming talks in the Spring include the [Lange Symposium](https://langesymposium.github.io/Lange-Symposium/), the [Oberwolfach Design and Analysis of Infectious Disease](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2308/www_view) workshop, the ESSEC [Working Group on Risk and Uncertainty](https://crear.essec.edu/crear-events/working-group-on-risk), [Bayes Comp](https://bayescomp2023.com) and its [Bayesian Epidemic](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/corbella/bcepidemics2023) satellite workshop.
