# [](#header-1)About

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Prior to joining the department, I worked with [Ken Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of California Los Angeles with support from the [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Prof. Vladimir Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Prof. Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [Prof. William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Catch me at some of these upcoming conference talks: ICML (Long Beach), ECOSTA (Taichung), ICSA (Tianjin), INFORMS (Seattle), IISA (Mumbai)
