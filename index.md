I am currently an [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177) at UCLA, hosted by [Dr. Ken Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702 ). I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under [Dr. Vladimir Minin](http://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/) in August 2016, where I was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). Prior to that, I received my BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012, supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to have benefited from the mentorship of [Dr. William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/) and [Dr. Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php). I also spent a semester studying mathematics in [Budapest](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).
