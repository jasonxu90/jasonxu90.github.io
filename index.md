# [](#header-1)About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University, with a secondary appointment by courtesy in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). 

Prior to joining the faculty at Duke, I worked with [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of California Los Angeles with support from the [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Volodymyr Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William Vélez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Some recent and upcoming:

* I'll be giving talks this summer at [Casa Matemática Oaxaca](https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5152), [Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques](https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2768.html), the [Computational Genomics Summer Institute at UCLA](http://computationalgenomics.bioinformatics.ucla.edu), and the [Joint Statistics Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2023/). If you are near, always happy to chat about math over a coffee

* Research assistant Jenny Huang received the [NSF GRFP](https://www.research.gov/grfp/Login.do) and the [Quad Fellowship](https://stat.duke.edu/news/senior-jenny-huang-statistical-science-receive-new-quad-fellowship-doctoral-study). Congratulations!

* Research assistant Rick Presman's [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12258) will be featured as an Oral Presentation at [Artificial Intelligence and Statistics](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/accepted.html) (top ~1.5% of submissions). Congratulations!

* Research assistant Haoyu Jiang received a [Student Paper Award](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/student-paper-competition) from the ASA Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics Section. Congratulations! 

* I am Area Chairing ICML, AIStat, ICLR, and NeurIPS 2023.
