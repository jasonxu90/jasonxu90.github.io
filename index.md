# [](#header-1)About

I am currently an [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177) at UCLA, hosted by [Prof. Ken Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702 ). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Prof. Vladimir Minin](http://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/) in 2016, where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). Prior to that, I received my BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012, supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to have benefited from the mentorship of [Prof. Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [Prof. William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/). I also spent a semester studying mathematics in [Budapest](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).

I grew up in Tucson, Arizona. In my free time, I enjoy literature, bouldering, ambient music, cycling, and cooking new recipes. My experience with the latter reveals that science is not the only endeavor experiencing a reproducibility crisis.
