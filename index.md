# [](#header-1)About

I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/jason-xu) at the University of California Los Angeles.

Before joining the faculty at UCLA, I was primary faculty in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University. I was also in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu) by courtesy, and retain a courtesy appointment in both departments. Prior to Duke, I was an  [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177) with  [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en), and was an  [NDSEG Fellow](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656) at University of Washington, where my PhD was advised by [Volodymyr Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/). I grew up in Tucson, and received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William Vélez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/).

Some recent and upcoming:

* Together with Prof. Leo Duan, I will be teaching a short course on “Harnessing Optimization in Bayesian Inference” at JSM 2025

* Our foray into [typed point processes](https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/80/1/ujad015/7610191) received the [ISBA BBP Best Paper Award[(https://bnp14.org/bbp2025/) 

* Congratulations to group alum Raphael Morsomme on receiving the Student Paper Award in the 2025 ASA LiDS Paper Competition
