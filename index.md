# [](#header-1)About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). 

Prior to joining the faculty at Duke, I worked with [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of California Los Angeles with support from the [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Vlad Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Some recent and upcoming:

* Undergraduate research assistant Jenny Huang is designated [Class of 2023 Faculty Scholar](https://today.duke.edu/2022/05/three-juniors-selected-faculty-scholars-excellence-research), the highest honor that the faculty of Duke University can award its undergraduates. Congratulations!

* I am honored to be a keynote speaker at the 2022 Lange Symposium.

* I am excited to be a long-term visitor at the Simons Institute program on [Graph Limits and Processes on Networks: From Epidemics to Misinformation](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/graph2022). You can also find me/check out talks at the upcoming ISBA (Montreal), ECOSTA (Kyoto), JSM (DC),  ICML (Baltimore), IISA (Bangalore) meetings

* I am area chair for [ICML](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/Dates), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022/Dates), [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022) and [AIStat](http://aistats.org/aistats2022/) 2022.

* I recently gave a Plenary Lecture at the [ISI Winter School on Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/wsdl2022/home) on designing MM algorithms, and attempted a layman's explanation of Power k-Means for [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2022/power-k-means)
