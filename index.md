I am currently an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UCLA, hosted by [Dr. Ken Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702 ). Previously, I received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under [Dr. Vladimir Minin](http://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/) in August 2016, where I was supported by an NDSEG Fellowship. 

My interests lie at the interface of statistical methodology and modern optimization. I am particularly interested in estimation for partially observed data arising from stochastic processes. These interests have lead to new directions in developing algorithms for large-scale and high-dimensional regression under sparsity, rank, and shape constraints. 

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on modeling and inference for the process of blood cell production. I enjoy collaborating closely with scientists and have recently applied my research to analyze medical and environmental data.
