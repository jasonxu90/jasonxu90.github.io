# [](#header-1)About

I am currently an [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177) at UCLA, hosted by [Dr. Ken Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702 ). Previously, I received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under [Dr. Vladimir Minin](http://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/) in August 2016, where I was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). Prior to that, I received my BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012, supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). I also spent a semester studying mathematics in [Budapest](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).

My interests lie at the interface of statistical methodology and optimization. I am particularly interested in estimation for partially observed data arising from continuous-time Markov processes, an exciting problem that combines spectral methods, stochastic process theory, and efficient optimization or sampling techniques. This work has lead to new directions in developing algorithms for large-scale and high-dimensional regression under a wide range of constraints including sparsity, rank, and shape restrictions. 

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on stochastic modeling and inference for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. I enjoy collaborating closely with scientists and learning about new domains; recent areas of interest include infectious disease modeling, statistical problems in medical imaging, and analyzing environmental data.
