# [](#header-1)About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/people/appointed-faculty/primary-faculty) at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in [Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). 

Prior to joining the faculty at Duke, I worked with [Kenneth Lange](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG6N6KMAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of California Los Angeles with support from the [NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606177). I completed my [PhD in Statistics](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37251) at the University of Washington advised by [Vlad Minin](http://vnminin.github.io/), where my work was funded by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1656). 

I grew up in Tucson, where I received a BS in Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2012. There I was mentored by [Kevin Lin](http://math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php) and [William VÃ©lez](http://math.arizona.edu/~velez/), supported by the [Flinn Foundation Scholarship](https://www.flinn.org/flinn-scholars/). 

Upcoming: 
I am area chairing for ICML, ICLR, and AIStat.

JSM 2021 is soon! Come to our Invited Session ["Advances in MCMC Theory and Practice"](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=220183), and you can also catch my talk on likelihood-based inference for epidemic models in the Invited Session ["Inference in Infectious Diseases"](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=220270).
