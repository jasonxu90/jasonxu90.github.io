# [](#header-1)Research Interests



I have broad interests in __stochastic modeling__, __machine learning__, and inference in __dependent and missing data__ settings. Currently, I am using majorization-minimization (a generalization of EM) to derive fast algorithms for tasks including clustering, regression under novel non-convex penalties, and constrained estimation. I am also developing latent variable approaches for posterior and likelihood-based inference in dynamic stochastic models, especially discrete valued continuous-time Markov processes such as branching processes and their extensions in spatial domains and over networks. My work primarily focuses on methodological development and theory, often driven by applications to systems biology and epidemiology. 

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on stochastic modeling and inference for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. Recently, Iâ€™ve gotten interested in epidemiological data and in emergent data types from single-cell lineage tracking and sequencing.
