My research lies at the interface of methodology for statistical learning/inference and optimization. I am particularly interested in inference under partially observed data arising from continuous-time Markov processes, an exciting problem that combines spectral methods and stochastic process theory. The computational aspects of this challenge demands the development of efficient and robust optimization or sampling techniques. 
This work has lead to new directions toward scalable algorithms for large-scale and high-dimensional estimation under a wide range of constraints including sparsity, rank, smoothness, and shape restrictions. A recurring theme in this recent line of work entails converting difficult (nonsmooth, nonconvex) problems into feasible subproblems via operator splitting or iterative schemes.

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on stochastic modeling and inference for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. I enjoy collaborating closely with scientists and learning about new domains; recent areas of interest include infectious disease modeling, statistical problems in medical imaging, and analyzing environmental data.

A list of publications is available [here](https://jasonxu90.github.io/publications.html).
