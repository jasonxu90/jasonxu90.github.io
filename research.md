# [](#header-1)Research Interests

I have broad interests in __stochastic modeling__, __machine learning__, and __computational statistics__. I am particularly interested in inference for __dependent, constrained, and missing data__ settings. 

Currently, I am using majorization-minimization (a generalization of EM) to derive fast algorithms for tasks including clustering and estimation under novel non-convex penalties. I am also developing latent variable approaches for posterior and likelihood-based inference in dynamic stochastic models, especially discrete valued Markov processes in continuous time such as branching processes and compartmental models. Recently I am particularly interested in their extensions over spatial domains and networks. My work primarily focuses on developing theory and methods, often driven by applications to systems biology and epidemiology. 

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on stochastic modeling and inference for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. Recently, Iâ€™ve gotten interested in epidemiological data and in emergent data types from single-cell lineage tracking and sequencing.
