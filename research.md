My interests lie at the interface of methodology for statistical learning/inference and optimization. I am particularly interested in estimation under partially observed data arising from continuous-time Markov processes, an exciting problem that combines spectral methods, stochastic process theory, and efficient optimization or sampling techniques. This work has lead to new directions in developing algorithms for large-scale and high-dimensional regression under a wide range of constraints including sparsity, rank, and shape restrictions. 

On the applications side, much of my work has focused on stochastic modeling and inference for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. I enjoy collaborating closely with scientists and learning about new domains; recent areas of interest include infectious disease modeling, statistical problems in medical imaging, and analyzing environmental data.
